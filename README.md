# Accessibility (A11y) Resources

Accessibility resources I cherish and refer to regularly! This list isn't meant to be comprehensive, as there are far better resources with that goal. You may have dozens (or hundreds?) of others that I'd love to hear about - but these are the particular ones that have stuck for me. 

## Podcasts

### [The InclusionHub Podcast](https://www.inclusionhub.com/podcast)

> Hosted by Sam Proulx, accessibility evangelist at Fable—a leading accessibility testing platform powered by people with disabilities—The InclusionHub Podcast takes listeners and readers on an insightful, at times enlightening journey through the many facets of digital accessibility and inclusion, from the early days of the disability rights movement to the present day state of the internet.
> 
> Guests include luminaries from the disability rights struggle, activists, advocates, and those who’ve made it their life’s work to ensure full web accessibility and inclusion, _for all_.

### [A11y Rules](https://a11yrules.com/)

> There is a lot of information about how to make the web accessible. There isn’t so much information about the people working to make the web accessible. Over the years that I’ve been involved with web accessibility, I have met a lot of very interesting people. I wanted to learn more about them, and meet new people involved in one way or another with web accessibility.
> 
> The A11y Rules Podcast is the result of this desire.

### [The Accessible Stall](https://www.theaccessiblestall.com/)

> The Accessible Stall is a disability podcast hosted by Kyle Khachadurian and Emily Ladau that keeps it real about issues within the disability community. Because we each have different disabilities and mobility levels, we approach everything we talk about with two unique viewpoints, offering our listeners a fresh insight into how differences in disability can color your experiences and perspectives. And we never shy away from offering our honest opinion. Even if they go against the grain of the disability community at large, we always speak our minds.
> 
> We try to bring honest discussions to the table each time we record an episode. We’re always trying to improve our content and – more importantly – ourselves. We genuinely welcome listener criticism and feedback.

### [The Heumann Perspective](https://judithheumann.com/heumann-perspective/)

> Join Judy Heumann, an internationally recognized bad-ass disability activist in conversation with disabled changemakers and their allies. For all fighting for social justice, these conversations around disability culture, art, entertainment, policy and advocacy are sure to light a rebellious fire under you to fight harder for all people.
